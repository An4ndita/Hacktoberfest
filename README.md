Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity for new developers to make contributions to real  world projects and get involved with the communities that maintain those  projects. All of this      happens through the GitHub code hosting service.  That can be a hurdle for anyone who's not familiar with Git or GitHub. If you want to participate in Hacktoberfest, but you don't have much experience with GitHub, then you've come to the right place.
